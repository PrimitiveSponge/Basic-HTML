    <body>
      
        <p>
            This is a paragraph <br>
            It is going to be a chunk <br>
            But becasue I could use Text-Align Center <br>
            It doesn't seem like a block...
        </p>

        <P>
            Another Paragraph <br>
            Just to have an example <br>
            because blocks can get strange
        </P>
